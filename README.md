# thalamocortical1
Large-scale thalamocortical network model for simulating physiological and paroxysmal brain rhythms (4 Hz spike and wave discharges) described in the PhD thesis: Dervinis, Martynas 2016. Pathophysiological mechanisms of absence epilepsy: a computational modelling study. PhD Thesis, Cardiff University. The thesis could be downloaded on the Cardiff university online research repository (ORCA): http://orca.cf.ac.uk/96981/

The repository will be documented in the future to provide examples of simulating major physiological network oscillations.
